# Hi, I'm Miguel 👋

I'm an Informatics Engineering master's student at Universidade do Minho, focused on data engineering, system design, and analytics.

I enjoy working on real-world problems using tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and MongoDB — whether it's building ETL pipelines, migrating systems, or exploring data for insights.

### 🔧 Some Projects I've Worked On
- ✈️ Flight delay analysis with Apache NiFi + Power BI
- 📚 Migrated an Oracle system to MongoDB and Neo4j
- 🧠 ML models to predict Alzheimer’s progression
- 🗺️ Geospatial data analysis with GeoPandas + QGIS
