# Hi, I'm Miguel 👋

I'm an Informatics Engineering master's student at Universidade do Minho, passionate about data engineering, system design, and analytics.

I like solving real-world problems with clean data pipelines, thoughtful architecture, and intuitive dashboards. I’ve worked across several tools and technologies, always aiming to bridge data and decision-making.

## 🛠️ What I Work With

- **Python** – for data wrangling, automation, ML, and APIs
- **SQL** – from transactional queries to warehouse modeling
- **MongoDB & Neo4j** – schema-flexible and graph databases
- **Power BI & Tableau** – data storytelling through dashboards
- **Apache NiFi & Spark** – building scalable ETL pipelines
- **Metabase** – quick insights over structured and NoSQL data
- **QGIS** – spatial data and geostatistics
